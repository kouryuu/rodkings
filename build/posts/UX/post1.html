<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A typical graphical user interface has many different types components,some of them &quot;do stuff&quot;
other are just there to give information about something.We have learned to discern different
types of elements within the GUI.
For example a GUI with an &#39;X&#39; inscribed or represented somehow is known to have the action of
<em>closing</em> or <em>deleting</em> something.On the other hand a number such as <em>07:34</em> would almost certainly
be something related to time.</p>
<p>In these examples we could deduce that a typical user understands the difference between <em>actionable</em>
elements and <em>informational</em> elements.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>####Actionable</p>
<p><img src="imgs/p1_actionable.jpeg" alt="Alt Actionable Elements"></p>
<p>Informational
<img src="imgs/" alt="Alt Informational"></p>
<p>So the conclusion of this introduction is that use cases of a User Interface
may be classified as <strong>Actionable</strong> or <strong>Informational</strong> elements (or both) and such elements should
 be distiguishable form one another.</p>
<h1 id="identifying-the-problems">Identifying the problems</h1>
<p>The examples seen on the introduction are so typical and intuitive that most people will have no
problem identifying the actions of such elements.</p>
<p>Modern GUIs rely heavily on icons and may confuse the user whether the element is <em>actionable</em> or <em>informational</em>.
The interface should have a clear distinction between these kinds of elements.Confusing an <em>actionable</em> element as
an <em>informational</em> could lead to undiscovered functionalities.</p>
<p>Another common problem is overloading the user interface with too many <em>actionable</em> or <em>informational</em> elements.</p>
