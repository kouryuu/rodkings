### Hi, my name is Rodrigo Reyes

Since very early in life, I became interested in technology and science.My passion grew as I discovered the complex yet beautiful digital world.I majored in Computer Science and continue to develop my passion, to make enticing yet functional tools.I strongly believe in the human part of every software code and hardware device, and its direct relationship in improving our lifestyle.

Also as Netwon used to say *If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.*, so most of the information is not my own; I read many papers, thesis, blogs etc. and I like to give proper credit to any source, if I forgot and you wish me to post a link to your site please contact me.
