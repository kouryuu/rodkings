My workout Hack
===============

The 'have no time' phase
------------------------

So as most of you the first excuse I had for not working out was **time**, yes I am a busy person and as such allotting time to go to the gym is complicates.
The thing that got me to excercise **every day** was an app called [7 minute workout](https://7minuteworkout.jnj.com/), so I figured maybe my busy schedule could squeeze in 7 minutes every day.
Also the best thing about these exercises is it only needs a chair to aid you in some routines, so it could be done almost everywhere at anytime.

Pushing myself
--------------

The most important thing about excersising is being consistent, so working out *sometimes* is not going to get you anywhere.
Discipline is tough especially for example when you get sick or injured; I got a common cold two weeks ago and although there was one day my body was too tired to do anything I at least achieved to stretch a little.
So three things you should think about when making up excuses:

- Time is no excuse.
- You don't have to go to a gym or a special place I usually do it right after I wake up in my bedroom.
- Being tired is not an excuse, excersise will in fact help you clear your head.

Increasing time
---------------

Doing 7 minutes at first is good, though I recommend increasing the time as you progress.I did 7 minutes for about a week, then increased to 14 (doing two reps) and I managed to do 45 minutes by now.

Eating right
------------

So yeah working out does make you healthier, but eating lots of sugar and saturated fats could outweight the benefits of excercise.
I currently have no particular diet, though I try avoiding candy and junk food as much as possible.

Next Steps
----------

As part of my plan of increasing my physical fitness I plan to join a local gym sometime soon and going ice-skating regularly.
But I will continue my daily excersises with the app, hopefully this article helps someone else as much as it has helped me.
Tell me your hacks in the comments :)
I will finish off with a quote.
