An Open-world can open our minds.

History of openness
------------

Since the dawn of civilization the power of humanity lies upon sharing knowledge amongst other people. We reuse, improve and build upon thoughts and ideas that other people have. However since knowledge is power, many groups of people guard their secrets as if they were made of gold. The Chinese hid the secret of silk manufacturing from the western world for centuries, to have a complete monopoly over the trade of such a highly sought item.

Nowadays patents, copyright and corporate secrecy help companies protect their ideas; but in many cases it stagnates development of improvements. Once I talked to a person who was very skeptical about the security of open-source software, he thought that it was insecure because it allows anyone to see its vulnerabilities. I convinced him it was the other way around; imagine a complicated clockwork, if a cog got stuck with something, an engineer would have to open the machine and inspect it right? What if the clockwork were installed inside a glass container and there were 100 people simultaneously looking for that thing that blocks the cog? 
Having the source code readily available accelerates the speed to detect and fix vulnerabilities.

So the philosophy around open source is people are free to reuse and improve on things and share those improvements to all. But it does not apply solely to software. Hardware can be open-sourced like Arduino, Open-RISC; but the most
