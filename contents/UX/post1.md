Action vs Information
=====================

Introduction
------------

A typical graphical user interface has many different types components,some of them "do stuff"
other are just there to give information about something.We have learned to discern different
types of elements within the GUI.
For example a GUI with an 'X' inscribed or represented somehow is known to have the action of
*closing* or *deleting* something.On the other hand a number such as *07:34* would almost certainly
be something related to time.

In these examples we could deduce that a typical user understands the difference between *actionable*
elements and *informational* elements.

Examples:

Actionable

![Alt Actionable Elements](/imgs/p1_actionable.jpeg)

Informational
![Alt Informational](imgs/)

So the conclusion of this introduction is that use cases of a User Interface
may be classified as **Actionable** or **Informational** elements (or both) and such elements should
 be distiguishable form one another.

Identifying the problems
======================

The examples seen on the introduction are so typical and intuitive that most people will have no
problem identifying the actions of such elements.

Modern GUIs rely heavily on icons and may confuse the user whether the element is *actionable* or *informational*.
The interface should have a clear distinction between these kinds of elements.Confusing an *actionable* element as
an *informational* could lead to undiscovered functionalities.

Another common problem is overloading the user interface with too many *actionable* or *informational* elements.
