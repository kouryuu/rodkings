Action vs Information
=====================

Introduction
------------

A typical graphical user interface has many different types components,some of them "do stuff"
other are just there to give information about something.We have learned to discern different
types of elements within the GUI.
For example a GUI with an 'X' inscribed or represented somehow is known to have the action of
*closing* or *deleting* something.On the other hand a number such as *07:34* would almost certainly
be something related to time.

In these examples we could deduce that a typical user understands the difference between *actionable*
elements and *informational* elements.

Examples:

Actionable

![Actionable Elements](/imgs/p1_actionable.jpeg)

Informational
![Informational Elements](/imgs/p1_informational.png)

So the conclusion of this introduction is that use cases of a User Interface
may be classified as **Actionable** or **Informational** elements (or both) and such elements should
 be distinguishable from one another.

Identifying the problems
-----------------------

The examples seen on the introduction are so typical and intuitive that most people will have no
problem identifying the actions of such elements.

Modern GUIs rely heavily on icons and may confuse the user whether the element is *actionable* or *informational*.
The interface should have a clear distinction between these kinds of elements.Confusing an *actionable* element as
an *informational* could lead to undiscovered functionalities.

Another common problem is overloading the user interface with too many *actionable* or *informational* elements.
When too many *informational* elements are present due to the lack of capacity of an average person to focus on more than one thing at the same time at least visually leads to missing information.Albeit some interfaces such as stock trading systems and control room systems need to display a lot of information, the users are experienced in detecting the information they are looking for.

When too many *actionable* elements are present the user may have some cognitive dissonance when exploring the interface.For instance say we have two buttons, both have similar icons in resemblance of a diskette; the difference is one of them saves the current file while the other saves the entire project;if the user saves the file only and closes the entire program having unsaved changes in other files the program will typically alert the user about the unsaved changes causing confusion.
