Changing my Workflow
===============

Awareness
------------

So lately I have been doing some Front-End work, and like many developers I am baffled by the plethora of options available out there to make a smooth and painless workflow.

Truth-be-told there is no perfectly smooth workflow, and its because of these rough edges we developers use and build amazing tools to ease mundane and troublesome tasks.

Most of the tools I discover are basically because I peeked at the source code of open-source repositories on GitHub and such, some are really life changing (*Jade/Pugjs saves me from HTML tag spaghetti hell* ) while others are quite bothersome ( *I am looking at you GruntJS and Coffeescript* ).

I have attended several developer Meet-ups and most of them orbit around people sharing solutions to common development processes; the curious thing is most of them are code-centric, it is as though people are anxious to show-off their code instead of really explaining the problem and the beauty of its solution.

Drifting away from the main topic here, I wanted to make a point about these Meet-ups;
