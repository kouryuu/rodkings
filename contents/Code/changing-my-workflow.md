Changing my Workflow
===============

Illumination

So lately I have been doing some Front-End work, and like many developers I am baffled by the plethora of options available out there to make a smooth and painless workflow.

Truth-be-told there is no perfectly smooth workflow, and its because of these rough edges we developers use and build amazing tools to ease mundane and troublesome tasks.

Most of the tools I discover are basically because I peeked at the source code of open-source repositories on GitHub and such, some are really life changing (*Jade/Pugjs saves me from HTML tag spaghetti hell* ) while others are quite bothersome ( *I am looking at you GruntJS and Coffeescript* ).
