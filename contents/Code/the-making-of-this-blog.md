The making of this blog
===============

Introduction
------------------------

So this post is related to how I came to build this blog and the perks/difficulties in the process.
I realised that as a software developer, sometimes we store a plethora of information and often times it gets misteriously erased due to the sheer amount.

So writing a blog may help to share the experiences and **store** that information in a way.

Having complete liberty to use any programming language and tool, I decided to build it such that it met three main goals:

- I am able to write an entry so long I have either an Internet connection or my laptop.
- The front-end is very easy to modify and configurable
- I have a clear and transparent process to deploy it to the live website.
- Write using a versioning system to make the corrections transparent and the process very fluid.

So the journey begins...
