The making of this blog
===============

Introduction
------------------------

So this post is related to how I came to build this blog and the perks/difficulties in the process.
I realised that as a software developer, sometimes we store a plethora of information and often times it gets misteriously erased due to the sheer amount.

So writing a blog may help to share the experiences and **store** that information in a way.

Having complete liberty to use any programming language and tool, I decided to build it such that it met three main goals:

- I am able to write an entry so long I have either an Internet connection or my laptop.
- The front-end is very easy to modify and configurable
- I have a clear and transparent process to deploy it to the live website.
- Write using a versioning system to make the corrections transparent and the process very fluid.

So the journey begins...

Software Analysis
------------------------------

I made an extensive research on different platforms and software such as:

- Jekyll
- Octopress
- Wordpress
- Drupal
- Wintersmith
- Metalsmith

So both **Jekyll** and **Octopress** seemed like a good idea, the thing that bothered me though was that both already had a directory structure (I like to make my own conventions and organise my stuff however I like) and changing some behaviours seemed bothersome.

Both **Drupal** and **Wordpress** are quite popular and powerful and being a Drupal power user I could easily create it with Drupal, the thing with CMS is that firstly there is a lot of files and bloated code.Second of all nothing beats the speed of static files and altough there are caching strategies that could make both almost as fast, there is still some overhead processing.

So then I gave a chance to both **Wintersmith** and **Metalsmith**.I explored **Wintersmith** first due to it being described as a "*Flexible, minimalistic, multi-platform static site generator built on top of node.js.*" , so I gave it a go.
