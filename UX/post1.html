<h1>Action vs Information</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A typical user interface has many different types components,some of them "do stuff" other are just there to give information about something.We have learned to discern different types of elements within the UI.
For example a UI with an 'X' inscribed or represented somehow is known to have the action of <em>closing</em> or <em>deleting</em> something.On the other hand a number such as <em>07:34</em> would almost certainly be something related to time.</p>

<p>In these examples we could deduce that a typical user understands the difference between <em>actionable</em> elements and <em>informational</em> elements</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<h4>Actionable</h4>

<p><img src="imgs/p1_actionable.jpeg" alt="Alt Actionable Elements" title="" /></p>

<p>Informational
<img src="imgs/" alt="Alt Informational" title="" /></p>

<p>So the conclusion of this introduction is that use cases of a User Interface may be classified as <strong>Actionable</strong> and <strong>Informational</strong> elements and such elements should be distiguishable form one another.</p>

<h1>Identifying the problems</h1>

<p>The examples seen on the introduction are so typical and intuitive that most people will have no problem identifying the actions of such elements.</p>
